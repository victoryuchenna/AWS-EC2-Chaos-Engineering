# Chaos Engineering for Resources in an AZ
## Introduction
The following workshop will walk you through the process of creating a chaos experiment to test a Microsoft Windows-based EC2 application architecture. You will explore some of the ways an AZ can fail and test the resiliency of the architecture.

## Chaos Engineering:
Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
Chaos Engineering lets you compare what you think will happen to your system when it encounters failure verses what actually happens to you systems. you can then use your finding to build a more resilient system for your workload.

It is not sufficient to only design for failure, you must also test to ensure that you understand how the failure will cause your systems to behave. The act of conducting these tests will also give you the ability to create playbooks on how to investigate failures. You will also be able to create playbooks for identifying root causes. If you conduct these tests regularly, then you will identify changes to your application that are not resilient to failure and also create the skills to react to unexpected failures in a calm and predictable manner.
